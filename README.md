### Preface

We are designed for developers to step into blockchain DAPP development, where they can learn **DeFi, NFT, DAO, CRYPTO** projects. We hope we could not only give **junior developers** a feasible and easy-to-use blockchain **DAPP** learning roadmap, but also present **advanced developers** with a platform for communication and cooperation.

We are a decentralized learning group to study the mainstream DAPP projects together and share thoughts every week. The weekly sharing will be recorded and uploaded to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DappLearning/videos).

We adhere to the concept of [open source university](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DQ3hWeVVXQ3JPbXFS) and follow DAO's governance. Currently, we are sponsored by [Ethereum foundation](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/), and accept grants in [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/3414/dapp-learning-developer-group-1). All the funds will be awarded to whoever makes valuable contributions to us. Please follow us on Twitter [@Dapp\_Learning](https://twitter.com/Dapp\_Learning) or WeChat Official Account [Welcome to Dapp-Learning](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xcH7b4jVIagoVby9Ci6-kA) to keep track of our latest progress.

We need more builders to help make our community grow -- contributors are welcomed from all backgrounds! Feel free to send us pull requests to set up new tutorials or improve our current tutorial projects. Correcting spelling errors is also helpful to us ðŸ¤—.

Join our developer community by submitting PR or sharing at [dapp learning university](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DQ3hWeVVXQ3JPbXFS). Once you submit three PRs, you will be promoted to be a pull request reviewer who could participate in our Dao's governance. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRYNYXqPeR) if you want to communicate any technical issues with us. For more **project management rules**, please see [how new members participate and project governance rules](https://github.com/Dapp-Learning-DAO/Dapp-Learning/blob/main/docs/dao-en.md). Welcome to join us if you share the same value.

### Project structure

The project is divided into two parts: **Basic task** and **Project task**

* **Basic task** Basic tools to familiarize and integrate blockchain development (e.g. ERC standard, Oracle, GRAPH, IPFS)
* **Project task** Case studies of the mainstream DeFi, NFT, Dao and other crypto projects to enlighten developers to deep dive into dapp development. We will organzie study groups to discuss and study project together.

### Preparatory Work

**Ramp up**

* Developers new to dapp development are strongly encoraged to learn the basics of Ethereum and Solidity before embarking on formal development. You can refer to [basic knowledge preparation](docs/basic-knowledge-en.md) to ramp up.

**Development tool**

* Sharp tools make good work. Familiarize yourself with basic development tools. Refer to [recommended development tools](docs/develop-tools-en.md) to view the current mainstream blockchain development tools.

**Recommended reading** We have collected a list of classic blockchain-related books to help developers know underlying philosophy behind blockchain.

* _Sovereign Individuals_, Follow public account [Unknown Scripture](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/homepage?\_\_biz=MzU4NDQwMTc3MQ==\&hid=7\&sn=124258360d0a530008a41ea32e7c2bf2\&scene=1\&devicetype=android-29\&version=28000b3b\&lang=en\&nettype=WIFI\&ascene=7\&session\_us=gh\_353f7f41a447\&wx\_header=1).
* _The Austrian School of Thought_ is recommended, [Hayek Life introduction](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/p1UZdt5BAQVJ3kl\_CniwKQ).
* Series articles [Austrian economics school of thought for blockchain enthusiasts](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?\_\_biz=MzU0ODk1MTE1MA==\&action=getalbum\&album\_id=1986143111768489985\&scene=173\&from\_msgid=2247484102\&from\_itemidx=1\&count=3\&nolastread=1#wechat\_redirect)

At the same time, feel free to keep expanding this [book list](docs/books-en.md).

**Cryptographic course**

We have collected some crypto courses from top universities and the Ethereum community to help developers systematically understand blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

* [MIT Online Course: Blockchain and Money by Prof. Gary Gensler](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/)
* [Berkeley Online Course:](https://berkeley-defi.github.io/f21) [Defi Learning](https://defi-learning.org/)
* [Standford Online Course: CS 251 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies](https://cs251.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)

We have also organized a translation group to translate MIT course 'blockchain and money' into Chinese, and upload all the chinese note-taking on our WeChat Official Account [Welcome to Dapp-Learning](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/79eRMtB\_yz8G6H8\_saCeLw)

If you have other high-quality course recommendations, we hope you can make a suggestion and add it in our course repo: [Recommendations for cryptographic courses](docs/crypto-course-en.md).

### Basic Tasks

Understand the basic tools and development knowledge of developing DAPP through the following basic tasks. For DAPP architecture, please refer to the article--[the difference between Web2.0 and Web3.0 applications from the architectural dimension](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/414635679?utm\_source=wechat\_session\&utm\_medium=social\&utm\_oi=778564687968092160\&s\_r=0). Learn and run the first 20 tasks locally and upgrade to focus on **project tasks** You are welcome to PR improvements to existing tutorial projects or to create more tutorial projects

Welcome to submit pull request,[Add a new basic task or update the above task](https://github.com/Dapp-Learning-DAO/Dapp-Learning/issues/new)

### Advanced task

**The preparatory work**: For developers with a certain foundation, this part selects mainstream high-quality projects for source code analysis and code review.

The project can be deployed to the test network and shared with the community as a basis. Large DEFI projects are complicated so we suggest to establish a study group to cooperate, ie. one for white paper, one for the front end, one for the contract, and one for data presentation.

Developers can initiate project research topic, form groups, and collaborate within the development community. This section is recommended as a submodule.

### DeFi advanced tasks

The DEFI bibles will set you up with a good fundamental understandings of the DEFI system.\
